## The benefit of activating the "Facebook Connection" ##
When you have enabled the "Facebook Connection" you can use the "I Like" button which can be found in the fullscreen view of the MediaPlayer.
By clicking on this button Sally will post your currently playing mp3 or video Facebook wall. For example you are listening to "The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears" from "Machine Head" Sally will post the following message to your wall:

```
likes 'Machine Head - The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears'
```

An other applications using this function is the cooking4life app. When clicking "I Like" button when looking at a recipe, the app posts the recipe to your wall. With all informations like link to the cookin4life recipe and a image of the recipe :)

#### Facebook App ####

Besides of the "I Like" Sally will store informations about what you have heard in MediaPlayer or to which radio station you where listening. This informations are shared to your facebook friends. So if you are listening to "Social Distortion - Machine Gun Blues", all your friends which are also using Sally will see this in the Facebook app. They can than click on "Search for this" to search this song on their music library. Or if one of your friend was listening to a cool radio station, you can also tune in by clicking on "Listen to".
The Facebook App also gives you the possibility to post a message to your facebook wall by using the "post message to your Facebook wall" button.


#### Facebook Connection Error ####

It can happen that you get a 'Facebook Connection Error' and Sally says that you need to reactivate the 'Facebook Connection'. But in most of the cases there was only a timeout to the server. So you don't need to do anything here.

You need only to reactive the connection when you have connected from another PC (with another Sally installation) to your Facebook account. In all other cases there should be a kind of 'self healing' for this error :)
