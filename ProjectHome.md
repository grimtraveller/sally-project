## Once upon a timeâ€¦ ##

Sally was just an idea of an application for All-in-one-PCs with touchscreen that should be the center of your everyday life. She should be easy to handle and able to manage a whole bunch of tasks. Sally was supposed to be cookbook, a notebook, your task manager, multimedia center and connection to your social networks. And Sally's outfit should fit your mood. The heart of Sally was thought to be an easy-to-handle touchscreen interface that uses different apps to manage lots of different tasks and can switch her whole appearance by using various themes as you know from your mobile. Some months later, Sally saw the day of light and was presented to an enthusiastic little crowd for the first time. Today, Sally has come to age and is much more than that. She is not only designed for touchscreens, she can also be used on computers with common input devices such as mouse or keyboard and with remote controls. Download Sally for free and change your mind!
