Here you will learn how to create a new Sally application by using Visual Studio.

<font color="#AA2222">
==Warning==
 I would suggest that you are not using your normal Sally installation for the testing. Make a copy of the complete folder for example from *C:\Program Files (x86)\Sally Project* to *C:\dev\Sally Project*. So it will later easier to test the installer. Also you can remove all other plugins from this installation (remove the subfolders from the application folder).}}

==Info==
 All screenshots are from a German version of Visual Studio 2008 - I will change this as soon as possible.

== Creating the Project ==

http://fileserver.sally-project.de/dev/wiki/DevFirstAppNew2.jpg
http://fileserver.sally-project.de/dev/wiki/DevFirstAppNew3.jpg

 * First open your Visual Studio
 * Select *File* -> *New* -> *Project...* from the menu bar


 * Select from the left side *Visual C++* and than *Win32*. On the right side select *Win32-Project*.
 * Than type in the name of your application. e.g. *TestApp* and select a storage location.
 * Confirm this dialog by pressing *Ok* (see Screenshot 1).


 * On upcoming wizard, select *Application Options* from the left menu and than select *DLL* and *create empty Project*.
 * Click Finish (see Screenshot 2).


== Creating the First Files ==

http://fileserver.sally-project.de/dev/wiki/DevFirstAppNew4.jpg

Now we need to create some basic files.
We need the following files:

 * dllmain.cpp
 * define.h
 * App.cpp
 * App.h

To do this, make a right click on your project an than select Add -> New Element
Select *Code* from the left side and type the name of the first file *dllmain.cpp* and repeat this for all other files (see Screenshot 3).

Now we can add the code to the files.

==== dllmain.cpp ====

{{{
#include <sallyAPI\sallyAPI.h>

#pragma comment(lib, "sallyAPI.lib")
#define EXPORT __declspec (dllexport) 
#define DLL_IMPORT_SALLY_API 1

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,
					  DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
					  LPVOID lpReserved
					  )
{
	return TRUE;
}

#include "App.h"

extern "C" EXPORT SallyAPI::GUI::CApplicationWindow* 
	CreateApplication(SallyAPI::GUI::CGUIBaseObject *parent, int graphicId,
									const std::string& pluginPath)
{
	CApp* app;

	app = new CApp(parent, graphicId, pluginPath);
	return app;
}
}}}

==== define.h ====

This will be empty for now

{{{


}}}

==== App.h ====

{{{
#pragma once
#include <sallyAPI\sallyAPI.h>
#include "Define.h"

class CApp :
	public SallyAPI::GUI::CApplicationWindow
{
private:

public:
	CApp(SallyAPI::GUI::CGUIBaseObject* parent, int graphicId, const std::string& pluginPath);
	virtual ~CApp();
};

}}}

==== App.cpp ====

{{{
#include "App.h"

CApp::CApp(SallyAPI::GUI::CGUIBaseObject* parent, int graphicId, const std::string& pluginPath)
	:SallyAPI::GUI::CApplicationWindow(parent, graphicId, pluginPath)
{
}


CApp::~CApp()
{
}
}}}

== Create the Resource Folders ==

Navigate now to your Sally installation.
For example: *C:\dev\Sally Project*

Open the application folder and create a new folder based. This should represent an unique id.
Please follow this instructions to create the folder name:

An example: *de.der-knob.sally.app.calculator*

If you have a homepage, than use this URL. If you don't, than just think of what your URLwould be ;)
The first part of the folder is my URL reverse http://www.der-knob.de => de.der-knob

Than the *sally* part indicates that it belongs to the project sally and app says that it is an application. The last part *calculator* is the name of the application.


==== manifest.ini ====

Create inside this folder a file named manifest.ini

{{{
[info]
apiVersion=0.7.7.1
name=Paint Board
author=Christian Knobloch
version=1.0.0.6
uid=de.der-knob.sally.app.paintboard
}}}

|| *Value* || *Description* ||
||apiVersion||The version number of the API you are using||
||name||The name of the application||
||author||The name of the author||
||version||Version number of the application||
||uid||This is the uid which is the same as the folder name||

==== pictures ====

Than create inside your app folder a new folder named *pictures*.
Here you can place a png image with 128x128 named *app.png*.
This image will be the application icon.

For example:

http://fileserver.sally-project.de/dev/wiki/App.png

== Make the Project Settings ==

http://fileserver.sally-project.de/dev/wiki/VsProperties1.jpg

Now we have to adjust the project settings.
Go back to your Visual Studio and select *Project* -> *Properties* from the menu bar.
Select *General* from the left side and change the *Zeichnsatz* to *Multy-Byte* and click *Accept* (see Screenshot 4).

Than select Linker from the left side and change the fist property "Output file".
Change this to the *installation folder of Sally* + *applications* + *your application folder* and leave the *$(ProjectName).dll* at the end

For example: *C:\dev\Sally Project\applications\de.der-knob.sally.app.myproject\$(ProjectName).dll*

Than you can close this dialog by pressing *OK*

== First Build ==

Hit F5 to build the project. By the upcoming dialog, select the sally.exe

For example: *C:\dev\Sally Project\sally.exe*

==== Possible Problems ====

When you get the following LINK error than you don't have the permission to write to this folder:

{{{
1>LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'C:\dev\Sally Project\applications\de.der-knob.sally.app.myproject\myProject.dll'
}}}

Please start your VisualStudio as Administrator (right click on the icon -> Run as administrator)
